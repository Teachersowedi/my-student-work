<p> ACTIVITY OF INTERGRATION </P>
For many years, soap has been used domestically for cleansing purposes and many families wish to be able to access soap but they are failing since it is expensive to constantly buy. The local council chairperson has organized a village meeting in which the villagers are going to be taught how soap can be made at home.
TASK: 
As a chemistry student who learnt the process of making soap, the chairperson has invited you to be the main speaker and facilitator in the meeting, therefore, develop a speech you will deliver in the meeting about the process of making soap at home. Your procedures should be precise and don’t forget the safety precautions.
